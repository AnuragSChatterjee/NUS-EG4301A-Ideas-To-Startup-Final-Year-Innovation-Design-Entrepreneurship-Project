# NUS-EG4301A-Ideas-To-Startup-Final-Year-Innovation-Design-Entrepreneurship-Project
Our final year iDP entrepreneurship project where we aim to integrate different brands of devices into a single network for smarter homes to enable a more convenient lifestyle for Singaporeans. I have been entrusted with the responsibility of being the In-Charge of the Marketing, Design and Technical Architecture of the startup project.

I have included all the portions which I have done which are as follows:

1. Technical architecture diagram for the backend development for connecting Zigbee, WiFi and BLE devices over Zigbee2MQTT and LoRaWan protocols 
2. UI/UX Design: Figma design for our smart home app developed where I helped contribute to the last few pages
